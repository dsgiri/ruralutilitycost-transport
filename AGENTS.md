# AGENTS.md

Act as a senior engineering manager, staff software engineer, and AI coding workflow architect. This file serves as the definitive instruction set for AI coding agents to ensure consistent, high-quality, and safe repository maintenance.

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to the development and maintenance of Rural Ops Tools - Transport Hub. This file provides reusable, repo-level instructions to AI coding agents to ensure predictable, clean, and safe development.

## Project Priorities
- Build useful tools that solve specific, painful user workflows.
- Keep UX practical, performant, and mobile-first.
- Support growth and discoverability through specific, topically focused content.
- Keep code simple, maintainable, and readable.
- Make pages conversion-oriented and clear.
- Avoid "platform" thinking or overengineering unless explicitly requested.

## Agent Operating Rules
- Work in small, incremental steps.
- Do not rewrite unrelated files.
- Preserve existing behavior unless intentionally changing it.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating duplicates.
- If blocked, leave a clear note in the code or task summary.
- Do not invent fake APIs, integrations, or data structures.
- Do not add dependencies unless necessary; explain why if you do.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions; favor simplicity.
- Keep implementation production-minded.
- Prefer semantic HTML, accessible UI, and clean structure.
- Do not use placeholder marketing fluff.
- Always make output specific to the project's domain when relevant.

## Product and UX Rules
- Each feature must solve one narrow, painful workflow.
- Every page must explain the problem and solution in under 5 seconds.
- Mobile-first is mandatory.
- Avoid generic startup language and SaaS-isms.
- Avoid purple/blue AI gradients, glassmorphism, and generic icon grids.
- Use a practical, outcome-driven design.
- Copy must be plainspoken and action-oriented.
- Structure pages around problems, workflows, trust, and clear CTAs.
- Ensure pages are easy to scan.
- Use strong visual hierarchy.
- Keep forms short, useful, and error-tolerant.

## SEO and Content Rules
- One primary keyword theme per page.
- One H1 only.
- Use descriptive title tags and meta descriptions.
- Use internal links to related tools and guide pages.
- Add FAQ sections when relevant.
- Use natural-language headings.
- Write for real users first, search engines second.
- Avoid keyword stuffing.
- Favor problem-based search intent.
- Keep pages topically focused.
- Tool pages must include: Definition, Who-it’s-for, What-problem-it-solves, Core features, and FAQ structure.

## Code Style and Implementation Preferences
- Keep components small, readable, and reusable.
- Use descriptive naming conventions.
- Avoid magic constants.
- Prefer explicit logic over clever, hidden shortcuts.
- Keep CSS organized; do not over-nest styles.
- Avoid giant files.
- Preserve accessibility (semantic HTML, alt tags, focus management).
- Minimize JavaScript where HTML/CSS is sufficient.
- Use comments only where they add real, non-obvious value.
- Prefer production-ready code over demo hacks.

## File and Folder Expectations
- Keep names descriptive and kebab-case.
- Landing pages: /pages or /landing.
- Tool apps: /tools/[tool-name].
- Shared components: /components/shared.
- Content/Docs: /content.
- Assets: /public/assets.
- Do not create duplicate versions of the same component.
- Prefer predictable, logical file locations.

## Build Workflow
- Understand the task requirements clearly.
- Inspect existing files to identify patterns.
- Reuse existing patterns and components already in the repo.
- Implement the smallest, correct change possible.
- Review for UX, SEO, and accessibility compliance.
- Run tests/linting if available.
- Summarize what changed in your output.
- Avoid broad, speculative rewrites.

## Testing and Validation
- Run tests and lint if present.
- Check mobile layout responsiveness.
- Check for console errors.
- Validate heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3).
- Validate CTA visibility and link functionality.
- Validate forms and error states.
- Ensure no placeholder text remains.
- Check accessibility basics (aria-labels, contrast).
- If commands are unknown, inspect package.json scripts rather than guessing.

## Safety and Change Control

### Hard Stop Rules
- Default rule: Do not delete, overwrite, rename, move, replace, or broadly refactor existing work without explicit user consent.
- Never delete any file without explicit user approval.
- Never overwrite or replace an existing file wholesale without explicit user approval.
- Never rename or move files/folders without explicit user approval.
- Never perform destructive refactors without explicit user approval.
- Never remove “unused” code, files, styles, content, or assets unless the user explicitly asks for cleanup.
- Never rewrite large sections of a file if a targeted edit can solve the task.

### Approval Required Before Proceeding
Any of the following changes require explicit consent:
- Deleting files
- Overwriting files
- Replacing page copy
- Moving folders
- Renaming files
- Broad refactors
- Dependency updates
- Config changes (deployment, env, db, auth, billing, analytics, SEO, routing)
- Schema/data changes

### Safe Editing Rules
- Make the smallest correct change to achieve the goal.
- Preserve user work; do not "fix" out-of-scope issues silently.
- Edit in place when possible.
- Leave notes instead of fixing out-of-scope issues.
- Create backups before risky replacement if you must replace.
- Prefer additive changes over destructive changes.
- If touching a sensitive file, minimize edits and preserve existing formatting.
- If an implementation looks wrong but is outside the requested scope, leave a note.
- No silent side effects. No stealth cleanup. No opportunistic refactors.
- Do not remove comments, docs, or content unless directly relevant to the task.
- Protect user-authored work by default.

### Change Summary Rules
- State which files you plan to touch.
- State whether any existing content will be replaced.
- Explicitly ask for approval if your plan involves risky changes.
- State potential risks before executing any risky operation.

### Prompting and Collaboration Rules
- This repo is used with "vibe coding" agents; assume high context, but be explicit about constraints.
- Follow structured instructions carefully.
- Return organized summaries of all changes.
- State assumptions when forced to make them.
- Do not ask unnecessary clarifying questions if the task is actionable.
- Break work into sections and maintain clean implementation logic.

## Definition of Done
- Task goal met.
- No broken layouts.
- No placeholder copy remains.
- Mobile-friendly.
- Accessible basics covered.
- SEO basics covered.
- No regressions introduced.
- Code is readable and maintainable.
- Summary of changes is ready.
